        <p class="about-description">I am Vekash, an Electronics Engineer. I have done my bachelors degree on Electronics And Commmunication Engineering. Besides that I like web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. And I'm also a linux enthusiast, who built linux from base using arch linux to revive old PCs.</p>

            <h3>Arch Linux</h3>
            <p>Arch linux is a barebone linux distro can be configure for server as well as Enterprise PC. Most of the linux distros are pre-configured with GUI like gnome and KDE which make it heavy for an old computer, so that I configure arch linux with only CLI makes it light and use less storage and RAM.</p>

            <h3>DTMF Home Automation</h3>
            <p>DTMF is Dual Tone Multi Frequency decoder IC, it is paired with a mobile phone to automate consumer electronics remotely. It relies up on the ability of DTMF IC to generate corresponding tone to a number or code in the dial pad and to detect the number code from its corresponding DTMF code.</p>

            <h3>Compact MIMO Decoupled Antenna</h3>
            <p>Decoupled antenna is used to increase cellular gain in portable device by spliting the antenna and place it in the device. When the antenna is activated by the device, the splitted antennas are work together and act as a single antenna by closed electric circuit thus reduce the space and increase the gain as well.</p>

            <h3>Automatic Light Intensity Control</h3>
            <p>In this project Light intesity is controled automatically according to the environment light. Here this circuit consists of LDR(Light Dependent Resistor), it reduce the flow of current according to light passes throught the Resistor, which affects the light intensity by change the voltage connected to the light.</p>
